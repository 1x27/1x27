Hello, I'm 1x27. I'm interested in anything Javascript, webdev, node.js, and especially Discord bots!

Currently I own a Discord bot called Fluidity which can be invited via [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=804083356677046312&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)!
That's all about me, thanks for taking the time to read this.
